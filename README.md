# Algorithm Playground

Recording my algorithm problem-solving notes with Jupyter Notebooks.

## Structure

## Naming Convention
- One problem per notebook, e.g. `0001-two-sum.ipynb`.

## Notebook Sections
- Problem Info (title, link, image, constraints)
- Intuition / Patterns
- Approach 1 (brute force) + complexity
- Approach 2 (optimized) + complexity
- Correctness reasoning & edge cases
- Tests
- Notes / Pitfalls
```
